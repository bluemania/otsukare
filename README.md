# Otsukare! Good work

A proof of concept website to help users learn Japanese.

This project was originally used in my masters degree for the 'Educational Technologies' subject. The subject had a lot of breadth, and I used this freedom to learn a new technology (the python flask framework).

The website is still online (although buggy) at https://otsukare.herokuapp.com/

*Always interesting to go back to old code to reflect on how far one has come. It's so obvious to me now how important a README.md file is, and it sucks that I didn't provide any getting started information!*

## Local usage

Project uses Pipenv. Can update the pipenv file 
``` bash
pip install pipenv
```

```
